# Hi,

This site is to keep track of projects and updates to my homeserver setup. It is mostly to force me to document things properly for my future self. But maybe one of the posts will be useful to someone with a problem specific enough to stumble across it. You can expect a lot of Docker, Bash commands and the odd Raspberry pi.
